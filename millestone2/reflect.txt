Hello,Dear professor Nasim Razavi. On this lab I increase my programmer skills,by making program with structures and used them in different file. I connect my header file and I understand better how to check strings data type with other string elements. Also I improve knowledjes in string type,while working wtih printf and scanf elements.I think milestones help to understand things better and understand algorithm of work. These skills will help us in future on our workplace.This work also is interested,because connected to real life problems.For example maybe in future some company will be interested in programmer with understanding how to create work programs for employees.Hear in this program we can add information about person and ask about his personal information which he want to add to his program.Very important information was in this work,thank you.Wish to make more programs like this.
