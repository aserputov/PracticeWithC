In this lab-class work we actually create a structure type which consider in 3 structure types. All this work took not so much, but at_home pat was to create almost the same work like milestone 2 but another way, using functions. There are a lot of advantages to use structures at all.but this way makes simple for companies to create a journal for their employee. Not to do all this work by hands(using a lot of code) and do it in a faster way by structure.And this code is helping us to understand how big software can work, if we will ad good user interface and but some simple forms for this. We are almost connecting to oop . Pointers because of not really importance of it. Here we can just use simple connection by same way how we do always.We don't use a pointers because if I want do a just a address for example I don't need to check all my structure of address and nubmers and names.
