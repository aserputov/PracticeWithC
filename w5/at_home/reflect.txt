This was fifth lab in my IPC144 lessons and I find it very important, because step by step I become true programmer guy. I used in this lab while loop and for. Used cases. But the most needed part was structures, because it help a lot. For example with had just few employees, but imagine if we had 100 or even 1000 employees, structures safe us. We can add different part of our employee. Structures saves a lot of place, lines of code  and time. We can add when employee start, his status in company and so on. We can use this not just for employees, but for grocery stores, which has thousands of items. We can right country of creation, price, date and e.t.c. So this lab was important like my first huge project, I spend a lot of time and learn new things to use in programs.
